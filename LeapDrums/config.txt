* INSTRUCTIONS:
* This file indicates what audio samples to load from the samples folder.
* The list below indicates the beginning of the file names that will be included.
* These file names indicate different instruments. The files in the samples folder
* should have the format, [filename indicated below]###.wav. Multiple samples of
* each instrument are included to avoid errors when the same instrument is played
* in quick succession.
* If you want to add your own drum samples, create multiple short .wav files and
* add the name of the instrument to the list below.
*
* ***IMPORTANT: THE .WAV FILES MUST BE 16-BIT FILES***
*
* Instrument names should not contain spaces. Instrument names should be unique and should
* not be substrings of other instrument names. E.g. both kick and kickdrum are not allowed.
* File names are case sensitive so instrument kick labeled here and sample file
* Kick01.wav is not allowed 
*
* Adding the '*' symbol before a line in this file means the program will not read that line
* 
* ***ONLY MODIFY BELOW THIS LINE***
